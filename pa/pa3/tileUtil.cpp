 * Function tile:
 * @param PNG & target: an image to use as base for the mosaic. it's pixels will be
 *                      be replaced by thumbnail images whose average color is close
 *                      to the pixel.
 * @param rgbtree & ss: a kd-tree of RGBAPixels, used as a query structure for
 *                      nearest neighbor search. 
 * @param map<RGBAPixel, string> & photos: a map that takes a color key and returns the
 *                      filename of an image whose average color is that key.
 *
 * returns: a PNG whose dimensions are TILESIZE times that of the target. Each
 * pixel in the target is used as a query to ss.findNearestNeighbor, and the response
 * is used as a key in photos.

/* buildMap: function for building the map of <key, value> pairs, where the key is an
 * RGBAPixel representing the average color over an image, and the value is 
 * a string representing the path/filename.png of the TILESIZExTILESIZE image
 * whose average color is the key.
 * 
 * We've provided a bit of the C++ code that allows you to iterate over the files
 * in a directory. It is up to you to figure out what it means, and how to use it.
 * 
 * @param path is the subdirectory in which the tiles can be found. In our examples
 * this is imlib.
